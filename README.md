RESELLr

RESELLr is a private, offline-first web app for resellers to track inventory, sales, and profit — without relying on marketplace dashboards.

It’s built for resellers who want clarity, not clutter.

✨ What RESELLr Is

RESELLr helps you answer:
	•	How much money is tied up in inventory?
	•	Am I actually profitable?
	•	What sells best — cards, comics, or other?
	•	Where am I losing money to fees or shipping?

It works alongside platforms like Mercari, eBay, and Whatnot — but your data stays with you.
